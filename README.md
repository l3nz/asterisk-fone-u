Fone-U for the Asterisk PBX
===========================

Using Fone-U APIs from the Asterisk PBX.

See http://fone-u.com

This project has nothing released yet. Please be patient.

We plan to release:

- An example integration with FreePBX
- An example integration for vanilla Asterisk
- An AGI script with flexible routing and retrying

Seems like the API servers at Fone-U are gaving some issues. It's a pity because this could be very interesting.
